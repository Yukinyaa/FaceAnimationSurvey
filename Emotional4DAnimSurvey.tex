With technology allowing for increasing realism in games and movies, facial animation is still a very challenging task.

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Animating expressive face in a autonomous way is a very challenging research problem.
Modern movie and game renders very realistic 3D face that delivers human emotion and lip motion accurately, but is labor-intensive.


Psychiloghcally, Human tend to be very sensitive to facial expression. Unnatural facial animation can be directly lead to uncannyness\cite{hanson2005upending}.


Capturing 4D human face and rendering it is a well-understood field(cite). But such approach requires gigabytes of data and hard to do.
and delivering such information real-time is a hard task.
This comes to where 

Generating such animation from auditory data is possible but lacks emotional information.

So, delivering emotional facial animation is important task.
